### Steps to recreate the working application: 
***

1. Clone the repository using git or you can directly download the zipped files.
2. Open the ![ESP Application][https://github.com/callmechristian/ESP/tree/master/ESP%20Application] folder.
3. Install the latest version of python and the required libraries like numpy, pandas, pickle, sklearn and flask.
4. Run the following command from your terminal to start the web application.
```console
python main.py
```
If all the required libraries were already installed, you could see the web application started running at the following URL
```console
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
(This application uses the port number of 5000 and runs in the localhost - 127.0.0.1 If you have any other application running at the port 50000, you can modify them in the main.py file)
